I'm an experienced cognitive and data scientist that help people with a lot of data turn it into something valuable.

In my current position, as a Product Analytics Devloper at Funnel, I use advanced data analytics (in Python, R, and SQL) to understand our users.

Previously, I've worked as a a research in psychology and as a scientific product owner at Tobii. As a researcher I conducted scientific studies into human behavior. Using advanced scientific methodology (e.g., eye-tracking) and advanced data analytics (primarily using R and Python) I investigated a wide range of questions in cognitive, developmental, and social psychology. At Tobii, I built software that eye-tracking researchers use to record and analyze experiments. I worked to make sure the software had the functionality needed and met customers high, scientific standards.
