I'm an experienced cognitive scientist that use data and advanced analytics to understand human behavior.

In my current position, as a Scientific Product Owner in the Tobii Pro Lab team, I build software that eye-tracking researchers use to record and analyze experiments. I work to make sure our software has the functionality our customers need and meets their high, scientific standards.

Previously, I've worked as a a research in psychology. I conducted scientific studies into human behavior. Using advanced scientific methodology (e.g., eye-tracking) and advanced data analytics (primarily using R) I investigated a wide range of questions in cognitive, developmental, and social psychology.
