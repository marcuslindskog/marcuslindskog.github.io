Below is a set of projects in various stages of completion. Projects listed here all have an associated GitHub repo. The link will take you there. If you are interested in the published paper related to a scientific project, you can find it in the GitHub repo or on the Publications page. Note that not all published papers have a repo. Only those where I can publicly share materials, data or analysis scripts have one.

If you are interested in details of any particular project, send me an email and I'll share whatever I can.

The tools used in the respective projects are indicated by an icon. I primarily use R ![R-logo](img/r.png), Python ![Python logo](img/python.png), and MATLAB ![MATLAB logo](img/matlab.png)
