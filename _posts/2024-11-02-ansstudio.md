ANS Studio now in Scientific Projects

For many years, I've studied the Approximate Number System (ANS). To do so, I've developed a set of I've developed a set of ![MATLAB](../img/matlab.png)-scripts that makes the process of creating stimulus and running experiments easier. I've now made these ![MATLAB](../img/matlab.png)-scripts available for anyone to build on and use. Perhaps someone can get started on their ANS journey a bit faster or run somewhat more controlled experiments using them.
